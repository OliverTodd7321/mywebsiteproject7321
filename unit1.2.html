<h1>Unit 1. Outcome 2.</h1>
<h2>2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
<p>In order to build my website, I had to use Visual Studio code in order to write the HTML and CSS code. I was also required to use Trello in order to plan out my project.
<br>
I found Visual Studio Code to be enjoyable, yet the programming languages used, HTML and CSS were unnecessarily long winded to use. I feel HTML has a lot of unnecessary jargon and terminology that could very easily be streamlined. CSS was outright confusing to use and I belive it to be an altogether obscene method to use two files for a sinlge web-page. One for the HTML and then designing the layout using a CSS file.
<br>
I found the use of Trello for a small project with a very limited time-frame to be altogether unnecessary. If I was to repeat this project again, I would not use Trello and this would free up much needed time to complete the coding and add to the styling of the website.
</p>
<h3>2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
<p>The tools used were vastly inapprorpiate for the time-scale I had in order to complete this project. If I am to be 100% transparent and honest here, I feel I would much rather have designed a website building program using Python or learnt more about HTML and CSS, instead of creating a web-page and being required to answer unnecessary essay based review questions. I feel that on a coding course, with a very limited time-frame, this was very much taking away from learning more coding skills.
<br>
I do not wish for it to come across that I do not value the necessary skills associated with project management, as well as the ability to work on an individual basis and review ones own work. I am simply stating that for a course on coding, this seemed very much out of the ordinary, and this thought was shared with multiple other students. Whether they will have voiced this feeling I cannot ever know.
<br>
I feel that the use of Slack was also obsolete during this project as, although I could communicate with other students and the tutor, I did not feel I could as this would impact my work.
</p>
<h4>2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h4>
<p>Overall I was very displeased with my website as I have had previous experience using other programs to design my own website before. I found with the limited time-frame we were given, HTML and CSS coding was incredibly time-consuming.
<br>
I truly hope that whoever design this course will review the ridiculousness of the second project compared to the first part, and the necessary changes will be made to the course.
</p>
<h5>2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h5>
<p>In a future project I would have used a more efficient, more streamlined coding language that did not require multiple files for a single web-page, nor all the unnecessary characters that HTML language requires. 
<br>
I would have enjoyed designing a complex website with all different kinds of hidden tricks and specialities, yet due to the strict time-frame, this was simply not feasable. I would have loved to have incorporated some throwback or outright copy of my random number generator game that I created for the first project, yet as this was coded using Python, I had to withhold adding this in and focus on other elements.
</p>
<h6>2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h6>
<p>I would rather be completely honest about my experience with this course, and risk a lower or failed mark, than pretend I enjoyed parts I thoroughly did not. Hopefully my comments have allowed the course designers to go back and change this course to make it more what it is sold as - a coding course.
<br>
I hope my comments and feedback allows for a redesign of the course. I am not stating that HTML should not be taught. I am simply stating that spending all this time answering essay based questions regarding project management should not be half of the course content. I am well aware that any career in software development would require strong project management skills, yet with only 3 weeks, I cannot help but feel that the second half of the course was hastily designed and not very well thought out by the designer.
<br>
I would have very much enjoyed to create a group based website with multiple fun games to create or perhaps some form of personal content, instead of creating a simple 'About Me' page and then answering review questions.

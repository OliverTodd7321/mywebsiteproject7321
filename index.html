<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> My name is Oliver Watson Todd. I am 23 years old and I am a junior developer for CodeNation. I am currently living in London and looking for potential apprenticeships wtih which to develop a career in software development and game design.</p>
<h3>University</h3>
<p>For University, I studied Mathematics, specialising in Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics. For my dissertation, I analyzed the Joukowski transformation for aerofoils, and determined the minimization of the boundary layer generated upon the surface of the wing to be a key factor in increasing efficiency of air travel.
<br>
For my dissertation, I was required to encode all 10,000 words on the program LaTek. This was required by all students, in order to generate the correct mathematical notation needed for our work. I very much enjoyed this task and even used some work from the program MatLab in order to simmulate 2-dimensional fluid flows.    
</p>
<h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
<p>I have multiple hobbies that interest me. The first I wish to speak about is Myrmecology. Myrmecology is the scientific study of social insects, specifically the study of ant societies. 
<br>
I have raised several colonies to maturity over the years, from the common black garden ant, Lasius niger, to the European Carpenter Ant, Camponotus ligniperdus. I designed and built custome set-ups for the colonies to live, thrive and grow inside naturalistic vivariums as I wanted to recreate a naturalistic habitat for the colonies to live in.
</p>
<h5>Career Prospects</h5>
<p>I am looking to pursue a career in software development. I wish to do this not only because the digital age is upon us, and versing myself in at least one programming language would be an absoloute necessity, but also because I love coding and problem solving.
<br>
What drew me to this course especially was the opportunity to learn a new skill, as well as to breifly peer into the digital world again as I have not done any form of coding since University.

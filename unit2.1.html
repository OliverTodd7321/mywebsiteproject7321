<h1>Unit 2. Outcome 1.</h1>
<h2>2.1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page.</h2>
<p>Each page was designed using the same CSS file that applies across the website. This was simply due to time constraints. With more time or using teams, this could have been changed to give each page more individualistic feeling.
<br>
I found myself struggling to think of things to write about on the 'About Me' section as I did not want to speak about my veganism and activism and this is a very polarising subject.
</p>
<h3>2.1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
<p>No copyright constraints weren't applied as all content used was my own.
<br>
If I had included any images or files from other sources, then this could have presented a break in copyright and therefore the website could have been taken down.
</p>
<h4>2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them  </h4>
<p>People with visual impairments who may need to use a screen reader could easily view all the content on the website.
<br>
If I was to include imagery, then having the audio description embedded in the code would allow for the screen reader to detect what the image is of instead of simply reading it as 'image'.
</p>
<h5>2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h5>
<p>The appropriate filetypes used were JPEG for images.

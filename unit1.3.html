<h2>3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
<p>Perhaps working in teams would have allowed for a better end-result. This is simply due to the strict timeline given and therefore team members would allow for load-sharing and greater productivity.
<br>
If I could do this again, it would be much more challenging and interesting to design a website builder with Python, or another language, similair to a Visual Programming language, and then quickly build a website, or each build a website, using our program, for example with pre-made elements.
<br>
Trello was outright useless for my project and took time away from coding or answering the unecessary essay questions. If this had been a team prject, with many groups of people working on a large project over a long time-frame, then I can clearly see the benfits of Trello there. However Trello is not scalable and does not work as well on the smaller scale, let alone on the individual basis, therefore I do think a review of focusing on Trello should be conducted.</p>
<h3>3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p>In order to keep myself productive, I took multiple 10 minute breaks at regular intevals. This allowed for greater productivity as having to answer essay based review questions on a coding course, instead of learnign more coding, did irritae me grealty.
<br>
Staying hydrated was also a key factor and wearing coding shades helped to keep myself from getting headaches or migraines, something I have been prone to in the past, yet did interestingly not suffer from during this course.</p>
<h4>3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h4>
<p>Next time I would have included team members to share the workload compared to the timeline. I would also have given a realistic timeframe for a project this large and complex.
<br>
With several team-members, the use of slack and Trello would be vital in order to comminicate ideas and information. Other forms of communication would also be essential, such as zoom or Google Meets. </p>
<h5>3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h5>
<p>Teamwork would help to improve testing of websites as multiple members may look at the same code and find errors or oversights that may have been missed beforehand by the individual.
<br>
Testing is vital in order to determine any errors or bugs in the program. Without testing all aspects of the final product and without pushing the program to it's limits, it could never be known what the limitations and the potential of the end results could be.</p>

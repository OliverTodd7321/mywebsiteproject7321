<h1>Unit 1. Outcome 1.</h1>
<h2>1.1 - Describe the purpose of IT in business.</h2>
<p>IT, or Information Technology has become so ingrained in almost every aspect of our lives, it would be hard to imagine a world without it, no pun intended. We now live in the digital age. A time where an individual's mobile telepohonic device contains more computational power than the flight computers of the Saturn V - the rocket that launched the bravest of humanity on the voyages through the cold, dark, emptiness of space, to land humans upon our moon.
<br>
To describe the purpose of IT in business is a very complex task. So let us first clearly define IT. IT is defined as 'the study or use of systems (especially computers and telecommunications) for the storing, retrieving and sending of information'.
<br>
We use IT in the most ingenious ways, from something so simple as the sending of electronic mail, referred to as email, to the tracking of sales, expenses, productivity, customer servicing, the list is almost infinite. And I must stress the word almost there. IT is vitally important in how businesses store and manage their data in the modern world, from the smallest of bakeries to the largest corperations. Gone are the days of paper filing systems, now we have the ability to access that data globally and almost instantaneously.
<br>
Modern businesses may also use IT in order to tactically improve their customer service. From direct feedback, to website 'hits', the tracking of customer activity has helped many businesses, such as the company Amazon, go from online book retailer, to now being a multi-trillion USD logistics company.  
</p>
<h3>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
<p>In order to make a digital prject successful, many tools and skills must be used, and many important factors must be considered. For large-scale projects, the use of teamwork cannot be under-valued. Successsful teamwork requires effective communicational skills. In order to help facilitate efficient communication, tools such as virtual meeting rooms are essential. With the global coronavirus pandemic, it became utterly unavoidable to use online communication and planning tools.
<br>
Another important factor in the success of digital projects is the knowledge of the programming languages that will be used. Not just knowledge of the language, but the knowledge of which language would be best for the specific project.
<br>
Scrum is an effective planning tool that allows for project progression to be accurately tracked each week over a four week time-frame. Scrum allows for clear and easy direction and planning for projects with a limited time frame. It can also allow for increased producticity as the scrum-master may review where productivity or efficiency is not optimum each week and offer advice or resources where needed. 
<br>
Trello is another valuable project planning tool that can be implemented to increase the productivity of projects. Trello allows for the easy creation and tracking of tasks, which will then be reviewed before being determined complete. 
</p>
<h4>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h4>
<p>To plan out my website, I will firstly research various websites that I believe find the perfect balance between aesthetics and functionality. I plan for my website to have very easy navigation via a hotbar at the top of each page. This hotbar would not vary from page to page, this is simply to avoid confusion, allow for easier and more efficient navigation of the website, as well as to save time with formatting. I aim for the design of my website to be simple and uncluttered without too much on a single page. 
<br>
Using Trello, I will create 4 main boards. Titled as 'To Do', 'Doing', 'Review' and 'Done' accordingly. This will allow for effective planning out of the website and it will also allow me to efficiently track and organise progress.</p>


<h5>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h5>
<p>Risk is simply defined as not going according to the intiialized plan. Whether this be the project runnine over-time or over-budget. There are more prominent risks associated with digital projects, such a cyber attacks, or hacking.
<br>
An important factor in determining risk are the knowns and unknowns. These fall into 4 distinct catergories.
<br>
Known Knowns - These are problems or delays that you expect and allows for the planning of counter-measures to be implemented.
<br>
Known unknowns - These are problems that are known to be unsolvable or not known to be solvable - there is a slight difference.
<br>
Unknown Knowns - These are unexpected problems that arise that are easily solved with known solutions or fixes
<br>
Unknown Unknowns - These are unexpected problems that may not have a solvable solution.
</p>
<h6>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h6>
<p>Choosing the correct technologies for a project can greatly increase productivity and efficiency. What must firstly be considered is the project/product requirements. It is important not to overload the project, using only as many technologies as utterly necessary. There is a middle ground that each project leader must find between using up-and-coming technologies, and the technologies that programmers and developers have knowleadge on.
<br>
The project must also be scalable and maintainable. Questions such as 'Can the program handle the intended level of user traffic?' 'Is it cross-platform?' or 'Will the program be able to handle future developments or new additions?' must be considered. Maintenance must also be given due diligence. The code cannot be unecessarily lengthy as this will require a lot of processing power as well as time. Larger codes could also cause small errors to generate bigger problems further down the line. The code should also be highly mobile and re-usable, this means that the code must be transferrable to other devices and not be limited to one single source.
<br>
Time constraints must also be considered. The use of pre-made elements or a Visual Programming language could help increase efficiency on a restricted time-schedule. A project with a longer time-frame will no doubt have much less errors generated, as this allows for more testing to be conducted.</p>
<h7>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h7>
<p>I personally believe Trello would be essential for large-scale, long term projects, where multiple different teams of developers are spending long periods of time on a single project, such as game designing. This would allow for team leaders to accurately and efficiently produce the desired results, combined with scrub, this can help keep to a tight schedule.
<br>
Personally, I have found the use of Trello to be time-consuming and almost unecessary. In terms of how has Trello helped me to plan out my website, it outright hasn't. I found I kept having to take time away from coding and answering the essay questions in order to update the Trello board.
<br>
I have thouroughly enjoyed learning Python and using Visual Studio Code. I won't admit a great love for HTML though as after only just learning and getting used to Python, to learn HTML has lead to some occasional confusion in coding.
</p>
<h8>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h8>
<p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It is the EU law for data prtection, data processing and data storage, designed to empower the individual. Personal data and information is defined as any information that can be used to identify an individual, whether this be name, age, gender or ethnic background.
<br>
Companies now must prove your consent to keep or use your information. Potential penalties are up to 4% of a companies annual turnover.
<br>
The new regulations have 7 main points.
<br>
Lawfulness and transparency. The processing of data must be lawful and transparent to the data subject.
<br>
Purpose. The company must process the data for a legitimate purpose, specified explicitly to the data subject when the data is collected.
<br>
Data minimization. The company must collect and process only as much data as absolutely necessary for the specified purpose.
<br>
Storage. The company may only store personally identifying data for as long as the purpose specified.
<br>
Accuracy. The company must keep personal data accurate and up to date.
<br>
Security and confidentiality. The processing must be done in a way so as to ensure appropriate security and confidentiality.
<br>
Accountability. The comapny and data controller will be responsible for being able to demonstrate GDPR compliance.</p>
